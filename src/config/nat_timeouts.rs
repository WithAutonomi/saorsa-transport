/// QUIC keep-alive interval for connections this node dials.
///
/// The dialling side sets the cadence for the connection. A keep-alive is
/// ack-eliciting, so the peer answers it, both idle timers reset, and each side
/// puts a packet on the wire once per interval — which is also what refreshes a
/// NAT mapping for that five-tuple. The accepting side carries only
/// [`ACCEPT_KEEP_ALIVE_BACKSTOP`], which this cadence normally holds off.
///
/// 10 s rather than the 5 s + 2 s pair it replaces. Because any traffic resets
/// both timers, the old arrangement ran at whichever interval was shorter, so
/// the effective cadence was the accepting side's 2 s and the interval is the
/// only real lever on idle egress. Measured on a 25-node testnet, moving to
/// 10 s takes idle egress from 29.8 to 6.1 B/s per connection endpoint.
///
/// The constraint on going further is NAT mapping lifetime, not the QUIC idle
/// timeout: RFC 4787 requires two minutes but 20-30 s middleboxes are reported
/// in the field, and if a mapping lapses the keep-alive is dropped before it
/// can provoke the ACK that would have refreshed it. 10 s is deliberately below
/// RFC 8085's 15 s floor for general-Internet keep-alives, for that reason.
pub(crate) const DIAL_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(10);

/// Longest the accepting side will stay silent on an otherwise idle connection.
///
/// The accepting side does not drive the cadence — the dialling peer's 10 s
/// keep-alive does, and every packet received re-arms this timer, so on a
/// healthy connection it has no room to fire. It exists to bound how long a
/// connection can be silent when the peer stops being heard.
///
/// Without it the whole connection depends on one side. A QUIC connection
/// closes silently after `QUIC_MAX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` with nothing received, and
/// with only the dialling side probing, a network stall is survivable for far
/// less than that: the connection is already part-way into its silence when the
/// stall begins, and afterwards recovery waits on the dialling side's probe
/// timer, which backs off exponentially. Measured against a recurring outage on
/// a harness, at the outage lengths sampled, the survivable stall was ~28 s with
/// both sides on a timer and ~16 s with only the dialling side; restoring a
/// timer here took it back to ~28 s across that range.
///
/// The value is bounded from both directions and 25 s sits between them.
///
/// Too low and it fires in ordinary operation and starts charging every idle
/// connection. The real gap between received packets on a healthy connection is
/// the dialling cadence plus a round trip, and more when a ping is lost and
/// waits on a probe timer, so the floor is well above 10 s. Restoring the
/// outage margin does not need a small value: 5 s was measured alongside 25 s
/// and behaved identically, because what restores the margin is this side
/// having a timer at all rather than how often it runs.
///
/// Too high and it costs twice over.
///
/// It crowds [`QUIC_MAX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`]. `handle_timeout` services timers in
/// `Timer::VALUES` order and `Idle` is ordered before `KeepAlive`, so if the
/// connection driver is not polled for the gap between the two deadlines, the
/// idle timeout is processed first and the connection closes without the
/// backstop ever being sent. 5 s is the nominal difference between the two
/// constants and the most that gap can be; the real separation can be smaller,
/// because sending re-arms the keep-alive timer while the idle timer is only
/// re-armed by the first ack-eliciting send after a receive. That is narrower
/// slack than the arrangement this replaces and worth knowing, because driver
/// stalls are a load phenomenon and load is what this change is about.
///
/// It also holds a dead peer for longer. The backstop PING is ack-eliciting, so
/// the first one sent after the peer goes quiet re-arms the idle timer: a peer
/// that disappears is retained for roughly the backstop plus the idle timeout,
/// about 55 s, against 30 s with no timer on this side and about 32 s under the
/// 2 s arrangement that preceded it. Subsequent probes do not extend it
/// further, since only the first ack-eliciting send after a receive resets the
/// idle timer. This is inherent to having a backstop at all and a lower value
/// would shorten it.
///
/// 25 s therefore favours not reintroducing the idle-egress cost, which is the
/// whole point of the arrangement it is protecting, and pays for that on the
/// other two. If the fleet shows either — connections closing without the
/// backstop under load, or dead-peer retention pressing on connection capacity
/// — a lower value inside the measured range is the lighter response than
/// removing the backstop.
