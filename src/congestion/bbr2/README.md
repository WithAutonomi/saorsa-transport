# BBRv2 — ported from cloudflare/quiche

Saorsa's BBRv2 congestion controller. The state machine (startup, drain,
probe_bw with UP/DOWN/CRUISE/REFILL phases, probe_rtt) and per-packet
bandwidth sampler are vendored verbatim from cloudflare/quiche; the only
net-new code here is the shim types and the `Bbr2Adapter` that implements
saorsa's streaming `Controller` trait on top of quiche's batched
`CongestionControl` interface.

## Usage

```rust
let config = P2pConfig {
    congestion_algorithm: CongestionAlgorithm::Bbr2,
    // ...
};
```

Or via the raw factory:

```rust
let mut cc = crate::congestion::Bbr2Config::default();
cc.initial_window(10 * 1200);
let factory: Arc<dyn ControllerFactory + Send + Sync> = Arc::new(cc);
```

## Adapter semantics (saorsa's `Controller` → quiche's batched API)

saorsa calls into the controller per-packet:
- `on_sent(now, bytes, pn)` — for each sent packet
- `on_ack(now, sent, bytes, app_limited, rtt)` — for each acked packet
- `on_end_acks(now, in_flight, app_limited, largest_pn)` — at end of ack batch
- `on_congestion_event(now, sent, is_persistent, lost_bytes)` — for aggregated loss

The vendored BBRv2 wants a single batched call:
- `on_congestion_event(rtt_updated, prior_in_flight, bytes_in_flight, event_time, &[Acked], &[Lost], least_unacked, ...)`

The adapter buffers `Acked`/`Lost` entries and flushes at the two natural
batch boundaries in saorsa's flow:
1. `on_congestion_event` → flushes ack/loss batches when loss detection has
   just produced a congestion event.
2. `on_end_acks` → flushes any remaining ack batch and resyncs the adapter's
   shadow bytes-in-flight value with the connection's authoritative counter.

## Known fidelity gaps vs upstream quiche

The adapter mirrors bytes-in-flight by summing packet sends, acks, losses,
and abandoned packets, then resyncs from the connection's authoritative
counter in `on_end_acks`. The controller trait still does not pass
bytes-in-flight directly into `on_sent`, so this shadow counter is the main
remaining fidelity compromise versus quiche's native recovery manager.

## What this gets you over saorsa's BBRv1

1. **Loss-aware startup exit.** BBRv1 exits startup only on 3 rounds of
   no bandwidth growth; BBRv2 also exits on cumulative loss count
   (`startup_full_loss_count = 8`), which prevents the "startup
   overshoots on real wireless links" failure mode.
2. **`inflight_hi`/`inflight_lo` short-term caps** cap bytes-in-flight on
   loss events, preventing BBRv1's infamous bufferbloat-plus-tail-drop
   behaviour on shared queues.
3. **Reno coexistence** (`enable_reno_coexistence = true` by default):
   probe-max-rounds scales with BDP, so BBRv2 shares bottlenecks fairly
   with Reno/CUBIC flows.
4. **Per-packet delivery rate sampler** handles stretch-ACKs and ack
   coalescing correctly (modulo the pkt_num proxy gap above).

## Default

BBRv2 is the default as of this port (`CongestionAlgorithm::Bbr2`). Its
default initial congestion window is 10 packets, matching RFC 9002/quiche
style startup behavior. To opt back into BBRv1, set
`congestion_algorithm: CongestionAlgorithm::Bbr` in the `P2pConfig`; CUBIC is
available as `CongestionAlgorithm::Cubic` for comparison or when probing an
unknown path.
