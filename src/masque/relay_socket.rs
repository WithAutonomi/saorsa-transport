//! MASQUE Relay Socket
//!
//! A virtual UDP socket backed entirely by a MASQUE relay tunnel.
//!
//! Implements [`AsyncUdpSocket`] so it can back a standalone Quinn
//! endpoint that accepts connections arriving through the relay.  The
//! node's **main** endpoint keeps its original UDP socket and is never
//! touched — this socket powers a **second** endpoint that provides an
//! additional inbound path.
//!
//! ## Routing
//!
//! - **Outgoing** → encoded as length-prefixed
//!   [`UncompressedDatagram`]s and written to the relay QUIC stream.
//! - **Incoming** → read from the relay QUIC stream, decoded, and
//!   queued for Quinn's `poll_recv`.
//!
//! ## Backpressure & buffering
//!
//! Both the send and receive paths use **bounded** `tokio::sync::mpsc`
//! channels rather than unbounded ones.  The receiver path gets natural
//! backpressure from `Sender::send().await` in the reader task: if
//! Quinn stops consuming, the reader stalls on the channel and QUIC
//! flow control eventually pauses the peer.  The sender path propagates
//! backpressure up into Quinn: when the send channel is full,
//! `try_send` returns [`io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`] and the
//! [`TunnelPoller`] blocks on a [`Notify`] until the stream writer
//! task drains an item and frees a slot.  This preserves the
//! reliable-stream invariant of the MASQUE tunnel — packets are never
//! silently dropped — at the cost of pausing the inner Quinn endpoint
//! when the tunnel cannot keep up.
