//! Process-global traffic accumulators (V2-834).
//!
//! The V2-623 counters are attached to individual objects (an endpoint's
//! connection table, a relay server's stats block). Production showed that a
//! single node process holds many more UDP sockets than it holds endpoint
//! summaries — per-dial relay carriers, rebind `prev_socket`s, relay-server
//! per-session sockets — so any object-scoped counter leaves bytes uncovered.
//! The accumulators here sit at the boundaries that *every* byte in the
//! process crosses, regardless of which object owns the socket, so their
//! totals match the host NIC by construction:
//!
//! * [`SOCKET_TRAFFIC`] — bumped inside the one real
//!   [`AsyncUdpSocket`](crate::high_level::AsyncUdpSocket) implementation
//!   (every QUIC socket) and at the relay server's per-session plain UDP
//!   sockets (its `recv_from` / `send_to`), i.e. every real UDP socket the
//!   process owns. The virtual `MasqueRelaySocket` is excluded without any
//!   per-call-site discrimination: its bytes ride a carrier connection that
//!   *is* counted here.
//! * [`FAILED_DIAL_TRAFFIC`] — the handshake bytes of dials that never became
//!   a registered connection. Folded from inside `Connecting`, because callers
//!   never hold a `Connection` for a failed or timed-out dial.
//! * [`RELAY_CLIENT_TRAFFIC`] — the client-side relay tunnel legs (stream
//!   bytes, keepalives, control frames, silent drops) across every
//!   `MasqueRelaySocket` the process creates.
//!
//! All counters are relaxed `AtomicU64`s bumped on hot paths and read by the
//! periodic summary task in `nat_traversal_api`; they are never reset.
