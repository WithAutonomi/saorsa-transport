//! The dialling side drives the cadence, and the accepting side's backstop
//! stays silent while it does.
//!
//! Two in-process endpoints are connected and left idle for longer than the
//! 30 s `max_idle_timeout`. Everything is read from the dialling side's
//! `ConnectionStats`, which sees both halves of the question: `frame_tx.ping`
//! is what this node sent and `frame_rx.ping` is what the peer sent, so the
//! accepting side's silence is observed on the wire rather than inferred.
//!
//! The accepting side does carry a keep-alive, but only as a backstop on how
//! long it may stay silent, and every packet it receives re-arms that timer.
//! The dialling peer pings well inside the interval, so on this path the
//! backstop stays silent — which is what `frame_rx.ping` being zero here
//! demonstrates. That is the cost argument for the backstop, so this assertion
//! is load-bearing: if it starts counting here, the mechanism relied on to keep
//! the backstop cheap is not working.
//!
//! It is one connection on a lossless, sub-millisecond-RTT path, so it
//! establishes the mechanism and not the fleet result. A real connection sees
//! the cadence plus a round trip between received packets, and more when a ping
//! is lost, so the backstop can legitimately fire on a degraded-but-live path.
//! Per-node idle egress after rollout is what shows the steady-state cost.
//!
//! `frame_tx.ping` is not a keep-alive counter in general — it also counts
//! DPLPMTUD probes, PTO probes and path validation. None of those should fire
//! here after the settle: the MTU search finishes in a few loopback round trips
//! and does not re-probe for 600 s, PTO needs loss, and path validation needs a
//! migration. That is an argument rather than a proof, so the test checks the
//! *spacing* of the PINGs too, which a stray probe would not match.
//!
//! This is loopback: no NAT, no loss, one connection. It shows the mechanism
//! works on an ideal path. It says nothing about NAT mapping expiry, which is
//! what actually bounds how long the interval can be.
